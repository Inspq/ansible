# This meta/main.yml exists to test that it is NOT read, with preference being
# given to the meta/argument_specs.yml file. This spec contains additional
# entry points (groot, foo) that the argument_specs.yml does not. If this file
# were read, the additional entrypoints would show up in --list output, breaking
# tests.
