# CAUTION: There are two implementations of the collection loader.
#          They must be kept functionally identical, although their implementations may differ.
#
# 1) The controller implementation resides in the "lib/ansible/utils/collection_loader/" directory.
#    It must function on all Python versions supported on the controller.
# 2) The ansible-test implementation resides in the "test/lib/ansible_test/_data/legacy_collection_loader/" directory.
#    It must function on all Python versions supported on managed hosts which are not supported by the controller.
