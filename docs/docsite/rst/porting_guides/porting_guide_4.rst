Ansible 4 Porting Guide
=======================

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 4 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/4/CHANGELOG-v4.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Playbook
========

* The ``jinja2_native`` setting now does not affect the template module which implicitly returns strings. For the template lookup there is a new argument ``jinja2_native`` (off by default) to control that functionality. The rest of the Jinja2 expressions still operate based on the ``jinja2_native`` setting.


Command Line
============

* The ``ansible-galaxy login`` command has been removed, as the underlying API it used for GitHub auth is being shut down. Publishing roles or
  collections to Galaxy via ``ansible-galaxy`` now requires that a Galaxy API token be passed to the CLI via a token file (default location
  ``~/.ansible/galaxy_token``) or (insecurely) via the ``--token`` argument to ``ansible-galaxy``.


Other:
======

* **Upgrading**: If upgrading from ``ansible < 2.10`` or from ``ansible-base`` and using pip, you will need to ``pip uninstall ansible`` or ``pip uninstall ansible-base`` before installing ``ansible-core`` to avoid conflicts.
* Python 3.8 on the controller node is a soft requirement for this release. ``ansible-core`` 2.11 will continue to work with the same versions of Python that ``ansible-base`` 2.10 worked with, however it will emit a warning when running on a controller node with a Python version less than 3.8. This warning can be disabled by setting ``ANSIBLE_CONTROLLER_PYTHON_WARNING=False`` in your environment. ``ansible-core`` 2.12 will require Python 3.8 or greater.
* The configuration system now validates the ``choices`` field, so any settings that currently violate it and are currently ignored will now cause an error.
  For example, `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_ON_ANSIBLE_VERSION_MISMATCH=0` will now cause an error (valid choices are 'ignore', 'warn' or 'error').
* The ``ansible-galaxy`` command now uses ``resolvelib`` for resolving dependencies. In most cases this should not make a user-facing difference beyond being more performant, but we note it here for posterity and completeness.
* Python ``module_utils`` imports may now be marked as optional during the module payload build by wrapping the ``import`` statement in a ``try`` or ``if`` block. This allows modules to use ``module_utils`` that may not be present in all versions of Ansible or a collection, and to perform arbitrary recovery or fallback actions during module runtime.


Deprecated
==========

No notable changes


Modules
=======

* The ``apt_key`` module has explicitly defined ``file`` as mutually exclusive with ``data``, ``keyserver`` and ``url``. They cannot be used together anymore.
* The ``meta`` module now supports tags for user-defined tasks. Set the task's tags to 'always' to maintain the previous behavior. Internal ``meta`` tasks continue to always run.


Modules removed
---------------

The following modules no longer exist:

* No notable changes


Deprecation notices
-------------------

No notable changes


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* facts - On NetBSD, ``ansible_virtualization_type`` now tries to report a more accurate result than ``xen`` when virtualized and not running on Xen.
* facts - Virtualization facts now include ``virtualization_tech_guest`` and ``virtualization_tech_host`` keys. These are lists of virtualization technologies that a guest is a part of, or that a host provides, respectively. As an example, a host may be set up to provide both KVM and VirtualBox, and these will be included in ``virtualization_tech_host``, and a podman container running on a VM powered by KVM will have a ``virtualization_tech_guest`` of ``["kvm", "podman", "container"]``.
* The parameter ``filter`` type is changed from ``string`` to ``list`` in the :ref:`setup <setup_module>` module in order to use more than one filter. Previous behaviour (using a ``string``) still remains and works as a single filter.


Plugins
=======

* inventory plugins - ``CachePluginAdjudicator.flush()`` now calls the underlying cache plugin's ``flush()`` instead of only deleting keys that it knows about. Inventory plugins should use ``delete()`` to remove any specific keys. As a user, this means that when an inventory plugin calls its ``clear_cache()`` method, facts could also be flushed from the cache. To work around this, users can configure inventory plugins to use a cache backend that is independent of the facts cache.
* callback plugins - ``meta`` task execution is now sent to ``v2_playbook_on_task_start`` like any other task. By default, only explicit meta tasks are sent there. Callback plugins can opt-in to receiving internal, implicitly created tasks to act on those as well, as noted in the plugin development documentation.
* The ``choices`` are now validated, so plugins that were using incorrect or incomplete choices will now issue an error if the value provided does not match. This has a simple fix: update the entries in ``choices`` to match reality.

Porting Guide for v4.0.0a2
==========================

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- AnsibleModule - use ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class for validating argument spec and remove private methods related to argument spec validation. Any modules using private methods should now use the ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class or the appropriate validation function.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme``) is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new Python modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).

Porting Guide for v4.0.0a1
==========================

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-test - The ``pylint`` sanity test no longer correctly detects "bad" variable names for non-constants. See https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3701 for additional details.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made SCM collections be reinstalled regardless of ``--force`` being present.
- NetBSD virtualization facts (specifically ``ansible_virtualization_type``) now returns a more accurate value by checking the value of the ``machdep.hypervisor`` ``sysctl`` key. This change is breaking because in some cases previously, we would erroneously report ``xen`` even when the target is not running on Xen. This prevents that behavior in most cases. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69352)
- Replaced the in-tree dependency resolver with an external implementation that pip >= 20.3 uses now by default â€” ``resolvelib``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71784)
- The ``meta`` module now supports tags for user-defined tasks. Internal ``meta`` tasks continue to always run. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64558)
- ansible-galaxy login command has been removed (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71560)

ansible.netcommon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed vendored ipaddress package from collection.

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``. Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified! This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

theforeman.foreman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All role variables are now prefixed with ``foreman_`` to avoid clashes with similarly named variables from roles outside this collection.

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A collection can be reinstalled with new version requirements without using the ``--force`` flag. The collection's dependencies will also be updated if necessary with the new requirements. Use ``--upgrade`` to force transitive dependency updates.
- Declared ``resolvelib >= 0.5.3, < 0.6.0`` a direct dependency of
  ansible-core. Refs:
  - https://github.com/sarugaku/resolvelib
  - https://pypi.org/p/resolvelib
  - https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2020/03/27/pip-resolver-testing
- It became possible to install Ansible Collections from local folders and namespaces folder similar to SCM structure with multiple collections.
- It became possible to upgrade Ansible collections from Galaxy servers using the ``--upgrade`` option with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``.
- Support for role argument specification validation at role execution time. When a role contains an argument spec, an implicit validation task is inserted at the start of role execution.
- add ``ArgumentSpecValidator`` class for validating parameters against an argument spec outside of ``AnsibleModule`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73335)
