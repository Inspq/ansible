Ansible 2.10 Porting Guide
**************************

.. warning::

	Links on this page may not point to the most recent versions of modules. In preparation for the release of 2.10, many plugins and modules have migrated to Collections on  `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_. For the current development status of Collections and FAQ see `Ansible Collections Community Guide <https://github.com/ansible-collections/general/blob/master/README.rst>`_. We expect the 2.10 Porting Guide to change frequently up to the 2.10 release. Follow the conversations about collections on our various :ref:`communication` channels for the latest information on the status of the ``devel`` branch.

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.9 and Ansible 2.10.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with `Ansible Changelog for 2.10 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.10.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

This document is part of a collection on porting. The complete list of porting guides can be found at :ref:`porting guides <porting_guides>`.

	Links on this page may not point to the most recent versions of modules. We will update them when we can.

Modules removed
---------------

The following modules no longer exist:

* letsencrypt use :ref:`acme_certificate <acme_certificate_module>` instead.


Deprecation notices
-------------------

The following modules will be removed in Ansible 2.14. Please update your playbooks accordingly.

* ldap_attr use ldap_attrs instead.
* vyos_static_route use vyos_static_routes instead.

The following functionality will be removed in Ansible 2.14. Please update update your playbooks accordingly.

* The :ref:`openssl_csr <openssl_csr_module>` module's option ``version`` no longer supports values other than ``1`` (the current only standardized CSR version).
* :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>`: the ``trust_image_content`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`iam_managed_policy <iam_managed_policy_module>`: the ``fail_on_delete`` option will be removed.  It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`s3_lifecycle <s3_lifecycle_module>`: the ``requester_pays`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`s3_sync <s3_sync_module>`: the ``retries`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* The return values ``err`` and ``out`` of :ref:`docker_stack <docker_stack_module>` have been deprecated. Use ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` from now on instead.
* :ref:`cloudformation <cloudformation_module>`: the ``template_format`` option will be removed. It has been ignored by the module since Ansible 2.3.
* :ref:`data_pipeline <data_pipeline_module>`: the ``version`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`ec2_eip <ec2_eip_module>`: the ``wait_timeout`` option will be removed. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.3.
* :ref:`ec2_key <ec2_key_module>`: the ``wait`` option will be removed. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
* :ref:`ec2_key <ec2_key_module>`: the ``wait_timeout`` option will be removed. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
* :ref:`ec2_lc <ec2_lc_module>`: the ``associate_public_ip_address`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`ec2_tag <ec2_tag_module>`: Support for ``list`` as a state has been deprecated.  The ``ec2_tag_info`` can be used to fetch the tags on an EC2 resource.
* :ref:`iam_policy <iam_policy_module>`: the ``policy_document`` option will be removed. To maintain the existing behavior use the ``policy_json`` option and read the file with the ``lookup`` plugin.
* :ref:`redfish_config <redfish_config_module>`: the ``bios_attribute_name`` and ``bios_attribute_value`` options will be removed. To maintain the existing behavior use the ``bios_attributes`` option instead.
* :ref:`clc_aa_policy <clc_aa_policy_module>`: the ``wait`` parameter will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
* :ref:`redfish_config <redfish_config_module>`, :ref:`redfish_command <redfish_command_module>`: the behavior to select the first System, Manager, or Chassis resource to modify when multiple are present will be removed. Use the new ``resource_id`` option to specify target resource to modify.
* :ref:`win_domain_controller <win_domain_controller_module>`: the ``log_path`` option will be removed. This was undocumented and only related to debugging information for module development.
* :ref:`win_package <win_package_module>`: the ``username`` and ``password`` options will be removed. The same functionality can be done by using ``become: yes`` and ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task.
* :ref:`win_package <win_package_module>`: the ``ensure`` alias for the ``state`` option will be removed. Please use ``state`` instead of ``ensure``.
* :ref:`win_package <win_package_module>`: the ``productid`` alias for the ``product_id`` option will be removed. Please use ``product_id`` instead of ``productid``.



The following functionality will change in Ansible 2.14. Please update update your playbooks accordingly.

* The :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
* The :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` module's ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from Ansible 2.12 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
* :ref:`ec2 <ec2_module>`: the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options will become mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you pass both.
* :ref:`iam_policy <iam_policy_module>`: the default value for the ``skip_duplicates`` option will change from ``true`` to ``false``.  To maintain the existing behavior explicitly set it to ``true``.
* :ref:`iam_role <iam_role_module>`: the ``purge_policies`` option (also know as ``purge_policy``) default value will change from ``true`` to ``false``
* :ref:`elb_network_lb <elb_network_lb_module>`: the default behaviour for the ``state`` option will change from ``absent`` to ``present``.  To maintain the existing behavior explicitly set state to ``absent``.
* :ref:`vmware_tag_info <vmware_tag_info_module>`: the module will not return ``tag_facts`` since it does not return multiple tags with the same name and different category id. To maintain the existing behavior use ``tag_info`` which is a list of tag metadata.

The following modules will be removed in Ansible 2.14. Please update your playbooks accordingly.

* ``vmware_dns_config`` use vmware_host_dns instead.


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* The ``datacenter`` option has been removed from :ref:`vmware_guest_find <vmware_guest_find_module>`
* The options ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask`` have been removed from :ref:`vmware_vmkernel <vmware_vmkernel_module>`; use the suboptions ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask`` of the ``network`` option instead.
* Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode`` are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need to specify them by themselves.
* The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase in transient failures due to AWS's eventual consistency model.
* :ref:`vmware_datastore_maintenancemode <vmware_datastore_maintenancemode_module>` now returns ``datastore_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
* :ref:`vmware_host_kernel_manager <vmware_host_kernel_manager_module>` now returns ``host_kernel_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
* :ref:`vmware_host_ntp <vmware_host_ntp_module>` now returns ``host_ntp_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
* :ref:`vmware_host_service_manager <vmware_host_service_manager_module>` now returns ``host_service_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
* :ref:`vmware_tag <vmware_tag_module>` now returns ``tag_status`` instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
* The deprecated ``recurse`` option in :ref:`pacman <pacman_module>` module has been removed, you should use ``extra_args=--recursive`` instead.
* :ref:`vmware_guest_custom_attributes <vmware_guest_custom_attributes_module>` module does not require VM name which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.
* :ref:`zabbix_action <zabbix_action_module>` no longer requires ``esc_period`` and ``event_source`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
* :ref:`zabbix_proxy <zabbix_proxy_module>` deprecates ``interface`` sub-options ``type`` and ``main`` when proxy type is set to passive via ``status=passive``. Make sure these suboptions are removed from your playbook as they were never supported by Zabbix in the first place.
* :ref:`gitlab_user <gitlab_user_module>` no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
* :ref:`win_pester <win_pester_module>` no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1`` which is built into Pester itself
* :ref:`win_find <win_find_module>` has been refactored to better match the behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:
    * When the directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer fail and will just warn the user
    * Junction points are no longer reported as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour matches the :ref:`win_stat <win_stat_module>`
    * Directories no longer return a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory
* :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>` no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart.
* :ref:`docker_container <docker_container_module>`'s support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used.
* :ref:`purefb_fs <purefb_fs_module>` no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs`` option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
* :ref:`nxos_igmp_interface <nxos_igmp_interface_module>` no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix`` and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
* :ref:`aws_s3 <aws_s3_module>` can now delete versioned buckets even when they are not empty - set mode to delete to delete a versioned bucket and everything in it.
* The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`grafana_dashboard <grafana_dashboard_module>` module is renamed to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
* The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`datadog_monitor <datadog_monitor_module>` module is renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
* The parameter ``message`` in :ref:`bigpanda <bigpanda_module>` module is renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.


Plugins
=======

Lookup plugin names case-sensitivity
------------------------------------

* Prior to Ansible ``2.10`` lookup plugin names passed in as an argument to the ``lookup()`` function were treated as case-insensitive as opposed to lookups invoked via ``with_<lookup_name>``. ``2.10`` brings consistency to ``lookup()`` and ``with_`` to be both case-sensitive.

Noteworthy plugin changes
-------------------------

* The ``hashi_vault`` lookup plugin now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.
* Some undocumented arguments from ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` have been removed; plugins using these, in particular action plugins, need to be adjusted. The undocumented arguments which were removed are ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode``.
