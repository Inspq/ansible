For legacy playbooks, IOS still supports ``ansible_connection: local``. We recommend modernizing to use ``ansible_connection: network_cli`` as soon as possible.

Using CLI in Ansible
====================

Example CLI ``group_vars/ios.yml``
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   ansible_connection: network_cli
   ansible_network_os: ios
   ansible_user: myuser
   ansible_password: !vault...
   ansible_become: yes
   ansible_become_method: enable
   ansible_become_password: !vault...
   ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q bastion01"'


- If you are using SSH keys (including an ssh-agent) you can remove the ``ansible_password`` configuration.
- If you are accessing your host directly (not through a bastion/jump host) you can remove the ``ansible_ssh_common_args`` configuration.
- If you are accessing your host through a bastion/jump host, you cannot include your SSH password in the ``ProxyCommand`` directive. To prevent secrets from leaking out (for example in ``ps`` output), SSH does not support providing passwords via environment variables.

Example CLI Task
----------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: Backup current switch config (ios)
     ios_config:
       backup: yes
     register: backup_ios_location
     when: ansible_network_os == 'ios'
