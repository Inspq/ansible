Hi!

Thank you very much for your submission to Ansible. It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken the time to contribute.

Per recent announcements at AnsibleFest Atlanta 2019, going forward we are no longer accepting new one off modules/plugins, or modules/plugins that create a new category.

However, we recommend looking into providing this functionality through Ansible Galaxy via Ansible Collections. You can find more information about collections at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html.

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!

If you have further questions please stop by IRC or the mailing list:

   * IRC: #ansible on irc.freenode.net
   * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project
