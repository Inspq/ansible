Hi!

Thank you very much for your submission to Ansible. It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken the time to contribute.

Unfortunately, we're not sure if we want this feature in the program.

However, we recommend looking into providing this functionality through Ansible Galaxy via Ansible Collections. You can find more information about collections at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/collections_tech_preview.html.

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!

If you have further questions please stop by IRC or the mailing list:
