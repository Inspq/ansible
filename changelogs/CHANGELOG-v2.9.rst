v2.9.10
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2020-06-18
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Add new magic variable ``ansible_collection`` that contains the collection name
- Add new magic variable ``ansible_role_name`` that contains the FQCN of the role
- Added missing platform guide for FRR (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69773).
- Fix a typo in remove_signature flag in podman_image module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67965).
- Remove the deprecation message for the ``TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS`` setting. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61889)
- The results queue and counter for results are now split for standard / handler results. This allows the governing strategy to be truly independent from the handler strategy, which basically follows the linear methodology.
- Updates ``ansible_role_names``, ``ansible_play_role_names``, and ``ansible_dependent_role_names`` to include the FQCN
- ``Display.deprecated()``, ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()`` and ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` now also accept the deprecation-by-date parameters and collection name parameters from Ansible 2.10, so plugins and modules in collections that conform to Ansible 2.10 will run with newer versions of Ansible 2.9.
- ovirt: update operating system options
- ovirt_storage_vm_info: fix example
- ovirt_vm: fix quotas example

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- ldap_attr, ldap_entry - The ``params`` option has been removed in Ansible-2.10 as it circumvents Ansible's option handling.  Setting ``bind_pw`` with the ``params`` option was disallowed in Ansible-2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 as it was insecure.  For information about this policy, see the discussion at: https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/ansible-meeting/2017-09-28/ansible_dev_meeting.2017-09-28-15.00.log.html This fixes CVE-2020-1746

v2.9.4
======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2020-01-20
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__

v2.9.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2020-01-15
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Fixed typos in various modules regarding argument_spec data types.
- dnf - Properly handle module AppStreams that don't define stream (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/63683)
- docker_container.py - update a containers restart_policy without restarting the container (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65993)
- docker_stack - Added ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and ``rc`` to return values.
- zabbix_* - underlying python module now required in version zabbix-api==0.5.4 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65145)

Bugfixes
--------

- **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14904 - solaris_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that. However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour. Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
- ActionBase - Add new ``cleanup`` method that is explicitly run by the ``TaskExecutor`` to ensure that the shell plugins ``tmpdir`` is always removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
- CVE-2019-14905 - nxos_file_copy module accepts remote_file parameter which is used for destination name and performs actions related to that on the device using the value of remote_file which is of string type However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection. This fix validates the option value if it is legitimate file path or not.
- Fix bandwidth calculation in nxos_ospf_vrf for Python 3 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66095)
- Fix for network_cli become method to be compatible with collections
