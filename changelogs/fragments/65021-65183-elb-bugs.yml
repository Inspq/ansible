bugfixes:
- "elb_application_lb, elb_network_lb - fixed errors during listener rule comparison which caused broken JSON, and which caused some values not being compared correctly. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65020)"
- "elb_application_lb, elb_network_lb - idempotence check for rules now compares all values order-independently, instead of just comparing the first value if multiple are specified."
