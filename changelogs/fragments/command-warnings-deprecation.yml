deprecated_features:
  - Starting in 2.14, shell and command modules will no longer have the option to warn and suggest modules in lieu of commands. The ``warn`` parameter to these modules is now deprecated and defaults to ``False``. Similarly, the ``COMMAND_WARNINGS`` configuration option is also deprecated and defaults to ``False``. These will be removed and their presence will become an error in 2.14.
