bugfixes:
        - "**SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials
          in log files.  inventory/aws_ec2.py, inventory/aws_rds.py,
          lookup/aws_account_attribute.py, and lookup/aws_secret.py, lookup/aws_ssm.py use the
          boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level
          DEBUG.  If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG_PATH to a value) Ansible would
          set the global log level to DEBUG.  This was inherited by boto and would then log boto
          credentials to the file specified by LOG_PATH.  This did not affect aws ansible modules
          as those are executed in a separate process.  This has been fixed by switching to log
          level INFO"
