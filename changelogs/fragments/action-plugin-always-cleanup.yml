bugfixes:
- ActionBase - Add new ``cleanup`` method that is explicitly run by the
  ``TaskExecutor`` to ensure that the shell plugins ``tmpdir`` is always
  removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be
  responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that
  we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary
  directory.
