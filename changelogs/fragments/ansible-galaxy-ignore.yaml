minor_changes:
- ansible-galaxy - Always ignore the ``tests/output`` directory when building a collection as it is used by ``ansible-test`` for test output (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59228).
- ansible-galaxy - Added the ability to ignore further files and folders using a pattern with the ``build_ignore`` key in a collection's ``galaxy.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59228).
