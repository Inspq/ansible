bugfixes:
  - >
     user - Local users with an expiry date cannot be created as the ``luseradd`` /
     ``lusermod`` commands do not support the ``-e`` option. Set the expiry time in
     this case via ``lchage`` after the user was created / modified. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71942)
