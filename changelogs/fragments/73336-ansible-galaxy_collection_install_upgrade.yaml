major_changes:
- >-
  It became possible to upgrade Ansible collections from Galaxy servers
  using the ``--upgrade`` option with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``.
- >-
  A collection can be reinstalled with new version requirements without using
  the ``--force`` flag. The collection's dependencies will also be updated
  if necessary with the new requirements. Use ``--upgrade`` to force
  transitive dependency updates.
