minor_changes:
- Templar - Speed up ``is_template`` by lexing the string, instead of actually
  templating the string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57489)
- InventoryManager - Speed up host subset calculation by performing direct host
  uuid comparisons, instead of Host object comparisons
