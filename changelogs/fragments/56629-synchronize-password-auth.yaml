bugfixes:
  - synchronize - fix password authentication on Python 2 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/56629)
  - >
    AnsibleModule.run_command() - set ``close_fds`` to ``False`` on Python 2 if ``pass_fds`` are passed to
    ``run_command()``. Since ``subprocess.Popen()`` on Python 2 does not have the ``pass_fds`` option,
    there is no way to exclude a specific list of file descriptors from being closed.
