minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - Most sanity tests are now skipped on Python 3.5 and earlier with a warning.
                   Previously this was done for Python 2.7 and earlier.
  - ansible-test - Removed ``pip`` constraints related to integration tests that have been moved to collections.
                   This should reduce conflicts with ``pip`` requirements and constraints when testing collections.
  - ansible-test - Most sanity test specific ``pip`` constraints are now used only when running sanity tests.
                   This should reduce conflicts with ``pip`` requirements and constraints when testing collections.
  - ansible-test - More sanity test requirements have been pinned to specific versions to provide consistent test results.
  - ansible-test - Improved handling of minimum Python version requirements for sanity tests.
                   Supported versions are now included in warning messages displayed when tests are skipped.
  - ansible-test - Silence ``pip`` warnings about Python 3.5 being EOL when installing requirements.
