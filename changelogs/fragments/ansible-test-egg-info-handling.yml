bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test`` against one Python version from another no longer fails
                   due to a missing ``egg-info`` directory.
                   This could occur when testing plugins which import ``pkg_resources``.
  - ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test`` no longer generates an error attempting to create an ``egg-info`` directory
                   when an existing one is not found in the expected location.
                   This could occur if the existing ``egg-info`` directory included a Python version specifier in the name.
minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - Generation of an ``egg-info`` directory, if needed, is now done after installing test dependencies and before running tests.
                   When running from an installed version of ``ansible-test`` a temporary directory is used to avoid permissions issues.
                   Previously it was done before installing test dependencies and adjacent to the installed directory.
