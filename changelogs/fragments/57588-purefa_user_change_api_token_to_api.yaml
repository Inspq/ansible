minor_changes:
  - purefa_user - change module parameter ``api_token`` to ``api`` and to stop clash with known variable.
  - purefa_user - change resulting facts from ``api_token`` to ``user_api`` for clarity.
    An facts alias has been added, but will be removed in 2.9. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57588)
