  **security issue** - copy - Redact the value of the no_log 'content'
  parameter in the result's invocation.module_args in check mode.
  Previously when used with check mode and with '-vvv', the module
  would not censor the content if a change would be made to the
  destination path. (CVE-2020-14332)
