minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - The generated ``resource_prefix`` variable now meets the host name syntax requirements specified in RFC 1123 and RFC 952.
                   The value used for local tests now places the random number before the hostname component, rather than after.
                   If the resulting value is too long, it will be truncated.
