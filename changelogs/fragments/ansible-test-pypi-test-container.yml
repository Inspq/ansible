major_changes:
  - ansible-test - Tests run with the ``centos6`` and ``default`` test containers now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used.
                   This allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.
