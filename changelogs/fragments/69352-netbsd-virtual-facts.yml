breaking_changes:
  - NetBSD virtualization facts (specifically ``ansible_virtualization_type``) now returns a more accurate value by checking the value of the ``machdep.hypervisor`` ``sysctl`` key. This change is breaking because in some cases previously, we would erroneously report ``xen`` even when the target is not running on Xen. This prevents that behavior in most cases.
